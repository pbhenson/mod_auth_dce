Introduction
------------

mod_auth_dce is an Apache module for DCE-based authentication. It allows
you to run the server with or without credentials, authenticate remote
browsers, and optionally serve requests with the credentials of the
browsing user. You can control access to files either via standard web
server configuration directives, or via DFS ACLs.

With mod_auth_dce, you can supply DCE users and DCE groups to the Apache
require directive, and restrict access to files or resources so only the
listed users or groups can access them. In this mode, mod_auth_dce will
request authentication from the browser on every request, verify the
identity of the browsing user, and optionally attach the user's credentials
to the process serving the request.

When used with DFS, mod_auth_dce can also use DFS ACLs for authorization.
In this mode, mod_auth_dce will check the DFS ACL for each request. If the
file requested is readable by the server, it will be served with no
authentication required. If the file is not readable by the server,
mod_auth_dce will require authentication from the browser and use it to
obtain DCE credentials for the browsing user. The request will be
reprocessed using the DCE identity of the browser, and if the file
requested is readable by that user, it will be served. Otherwise, the
request will be forbidden.

mod_auth_dce is most useful when combined with DFS. Once mod_auth_dce has
been installed, access to files can be controlled simply by setting DFS
ACLs, with no further web server configuration required. However, support
of standard web server configuration directives allows mod_auth_dce to be
useful at sites without DFS, and also for protecting resources that are not
files, such as Apache handlers.

Other features of mod_auth_dce include login context caching, and DCE
authenticated CGI execution.

mod_auth_dce currently uses standard Basic authentication to get the
username and password. With stock Apache, this means the password is
transmitted in cleartext. However, if SSL is used, the password can be
encrypted.


Installation
------------

To operate correctly, mod_auth_dce needs some minor patches to the Apache
source code. Please see the file README.PATCHES and apply the patch file.

Move the auth_dce subdirectory of the mod_auth_dce distribution to the
apache/src/modules directory after applying the patch. For example:

     cd /path/to/mod_auth_dce
     tar cf - auth_dce | (cd /path/to/apache/src/modules && tar xf -)


By default, mod_auth_dce has login context caching turned on. The caching
should increase performance, but more importantly, will significantly
decrease the load on your security server. If you wish to disable login
context caching, you should edit the mod_auth_dce.c file and follow the
instructions in it to disable caching.

You should also edit the mod_auth_dce.c file if you want to change any
of the cache options, such as the size or expiration time. Please see the
mod_auth_dce.c file for details of these options. The defaults should be
acceptable for most installations.

If you are using the Apache Autoconf-style Interface (APACI), supply the
option '--activate-module=src/modules/auth_dce/mod_auth_dce.c' to
configure. Otherwise, edit the Configuration file and add the line

     AddModule modules/auth_dce/mod_auth_dce.o

In either case, mod_auth_dce will attempt to set compilation options
appropriately during the configuration process. If mod_auth_dce doesn't
recognize your OS, it will complain and use defaults that may or may
not work.


Configuration Directives
------------------------

  Directive                 Context         Default Value
  ----------------------------------------------------------------
  DCEUser                   server          -none-

    To run the server with credentials, set DCEUser to the principal
    whose credentials are to be acquired by the server. This principal
    must have a valid account in the cell and an entry in either the
    DCE default keytab or the keytab specified in the DCEKeytab
    directive.

  Directive                 Context         Default Value
  ----------------------------------------------------------------
  DCEKeytab                 server          DCE default keytab

    Set this directive to the full path of a keytab that contains an
    entry for the principal specified by the DCEUser directive. If
    omitted, the DCE default keytab will be used. Note that the
    credentials are acquired after the server has set its uid to the
    user specified by the User directive, so the keytab must be
    readable by that Unix uid.

  Directive                 Context         Default Value
  ----------------------------------------------------------------
  DCEAuthAuthoritative      directory       On

    When this directive is On, mod_auth_dce will either approve or
    deny a request. When the directive is Off and a request is not
    approved (due to authentication failure or access restriction),
    mod_auth_dce will decline to handle the request and allow other
    lower level modules to attempt authentication.

  Directive                 Context         Default Value
  ----------------------------------------------------------------
  DCEBrowserCreds           directory       On

    When this directive is On, the credentials of the browsing user
    will be attached to the server process for the duration of any
    request requiring authentication. If set to Off, requests will be
    processed using the identity and credentials (if any) of the
    server.

  Directive                 Context         Default Value
  ----------------------------------------------------------------
  AuthDCE                   directory       Off

    When this directive is On, DCE authentication is enabled within
    the directory specified.

    You will also need valid AuthType, AuthName, and require
    directives in the Directory container. Currently, the only
    supported AuthType is "Basic". List the authorized users/groups
    for this directory in the require directive, or see below for
    correct require configuration if AuthDFS is enabled.

  Directive                 Context         Default Value
  ----------------------------------------------------------------
  AuthDFS                   directory       Off

    When this directive is On, DFS ACL checking is enabled within the
    directory specified and mod_auth_dce will only require
    authentication if the request is for a file not readable by the
    server. If the server is running without DCE credentials, server
    readability is controlled by the "any_other" entry on the DFS
    ACL. Otherwise, it is controlled by the entries that apply to the
    DCE identity of the server.

    When AuthDFS is enabled, your require directive should be set to
    "valid-user".

  Directive                 Context         Default Value
  ----------------------------------------------------------------
  DCEIncludePW              directory       Off

    Setting this directive to On will enable passing the browser's
    password to CGI programs via the environment variable DCEPW. Only
    enable this directive on web servers that do not allow interactive
    logins. Otherwise, users could use the ps command to potentially
    acquire plaintext passwords.

  Directive                 Context         Default Value
  ----------------------------------------------------------------
  DCEDirectoryIndex         directory       DirectoryIndex default

    This directive should be set to the same list of valid index files
    as the DirectoryIndex directive.

    mod_auth_dce needs this information to correctly serve server
    readable index files in non server readable directories when
    AuthDFS is enabled. Unfortunately, the list already specified with
    DirectoryIndex is not available to mod_auth_dce, necessitating
    this seemingly redundant directive.


NOTE: Previous versions of the documentation recommended not checking
      for symlinks. However, if your web server publishes user files, a
      user can potentially use symlinks to read other users' DCE
      credential files.  Therefore, the current recommendation is either
      to disable symlinks, or to only allow symlinks if the owner
      matches.


Configuration Guidelines
------------------------

Your first decision when configuring mod_auth_dce is whether or not to
start the server with DCE credentials.  If you start the server with
credentials, then all requests, authenticated or not, are processed either
with the credentials of the server or the credentials of the browsing
user. If the server is not started with credentials, then non-authenticated
requests are processed with no credentials, while authenticated requests
may be processed with the credentials of the authenticated browsing
user. If you are serving files in DFS, and the server has no credentials,
then any file to be served without authentication must by readable by
any_other. On the other hand, if the server has credentials, then files may
be served from DFS that are readable by the server principal, but not
necessarily by anyone else. This, for example, allows you to have CGIs that
anyone can execute, but no one can view. To run the server with
credentials, you must specify a valid DCE principal/account via the DCEUser
configuration directive. This account must have a valid keytab on the
system, readable by the Unix identity of the web server. Since you probably
do not want to have your system keytab readable by the web server, you most
likely need to use the DCEKeytab configuration directive to specify an
alternative keytab file. Note that only the child server processes obtain
credentials, while the parent runs with no credentials. Therefore, logs
must be writable by the Unix identity of the parent server, generally root,
or for logs in DFS, the DCE identity of the machine, generally
hosts/hostname/self.

Your next decision is which, if any, pieces of your web space you wish to
protect using DCE authentication. Once you have identified these pieces,
you need to create a Location or Directory container for each identified
piece and include an AuthDCE directive (set to On). Then, you must decide
whether to restrict access based on explicitly named users/groups, or via
DFS ACLs. To use explicitly named users/groups, provide require directives
listing the authorized users and/or groups. To use DFS ACLs for access
control, include the AuthDFS directive (set to On) and a require directive
(set to valid-user).

For authenticated requests, you must decide whether or not to attach the
credentials of the authenticated browser to the process serving the
request. This is the default behavior, and if you are using AuthDFS, is
required. If you started the server with credentials, and wish to serve the
request using the credentials of the server rather than the credentials of
the authenticated browser, you must disable this behavior by including the
DCEBrowserCreds directive (set to Off).


DCE Authenticated CGIs
----------------------

If you use DCE authentication for your cgi-bin directory, you can not only
restrict access to them, but when they run, they can also have full DCE
credentials of the browsing user. This feature can be used to create easy
to use remote DCE administration CGIs. For an example of the potential of
this feature, please see

     http://www.csupomona.edu/~intranet/services/


The identity of the browser is available to the CGI via the standard
REMOTE_USER environment variable. If DCEIncludePW is set, then the
browser's DCE password is also available to the CGI via the DCEPW
environment variable. Do not set DCEIncludePW on a web server that also
allows user logins, or the ps command could potentially be used to
compromise passwords.

You shouldn't allow untrusted users to place CGIs in a DCE authenticated
location, as they could then have their CGI run with a browser's
credentials.
