1.3 - Added DCEIncludePW configuration directive, which enables passing
      browser passwords to CGIs. Previous versions of mod_auth_dce
      always passed the browser password to a CGI, which on a machine that
      allowed interactive logins could potentially expose browser passwords
      to users via the ps command. Thanks to Mark Plaksin
      <happy@arches.uga.edu> for pointing out this problem.

    - Revised advice about symlink checking. Previously, it was recommended
      that symlinks be allowed in general. However, if your web server
      publishes user files, a user can use a symlink to potentially read
      other users DCE credential files. Therefore, the current
      recommendation is to either disable symlinks, or only allow symlinks
      if the owner matches.

    - Removed patches for Apache 1.1.3, 1.2.0, and Stronghold 1.3.4.
      Added patches for Apache 1.2.4 and Apache 1.2.4+ssl_1.9. Versions
      of Apache older than 1.2.4 are no longer supported. No version of
      Stronghold is currently supported, mainly due to their decision to
      incorporate IP address based licensing restrictions and not
      distribute full source code without a non-disclosure agreement.

    - Added support for credential caching under AIX. Thanks to Klaus
      Gottschalk <ox01@saturn.rz.uni-karlsruhe.de> for the implementation
      details of afs_syscall under AIX, and to Mark Plaksin for providing
      access to an AIX environment to test them.


1.2 - Added support for Apache 1.2.0 and included a patch file for that
      version.

    - Added ability to use web server configuration for authorization.
      Sites without DFS ACLs can now use DCE for authentication, while
      relying on require directives for authorization. Added new
      configuration directive, AuthDFS, to allow both web server based
      and DFS ACL based authorization.


1.0 - Patch for Apache 1.1.3 appeared to be for a nonexistant version 1.3.2,
      renamed patch and updated README.PATCHES.

    - Added patch for mod_userdir, which was using the r->finfo structure
      for a local stat. Added a local stat structure so the module would
      not contaminate the request structure, which was having side effects
      on mod_auth_dce.

    - Added new configuration command, DCEDirectoryIndex, to fix problem
      where authentication was being requested for a world-readable index
      file in a non-world-readable directory.


0.9 - First publicly released version

    - Thanks to Steve Moyer <moyer@transarc.com>, for invaluable technical
      support and advice on DFS issues, Doug MacEachern <dougm@osf.org> for
      help with context caching implementation, and Craig Rich
      <carich@csupomona.edu> for inspiration.
