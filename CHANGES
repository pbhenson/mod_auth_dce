1.2 - Added support for Apache 1.2.0 and included a patch file for that
      version.

    - Added ability to use web server configuration for authorization.
      Sites without DFS ACLs can now use DCE for authentication, while
      relying on require directives for authorization. Added new
      configuration directive, AuthDFS, to allow both web server based
      and DFS ACL based authorization.


1.0 - Patch for Apache 1.1.3 appeared to be for a nonexistant version 1.3.2,
      renamed patch and updated README.PATCHES.

    - Added patch for mod_userdir, which was using the r->finfo structure
      for a local stat. Added a local stat structure so the module would
      not contaminate the request structure, which was having side effects
      on mod_auth_dce.

    - Added new configuration command, DCEDirectoryIndex, to fix problem
      where authentication was being requested for a world-readable index
      file in a non-world-readable directory.


0.9 - First publicly released version
