3.1 - The sec_login_context_from_pag call was not available under
      AIX. According to IBM Technical Support, this call should now be
      available with the latest PTF set for AIX DCE. Contact IBM
      Technical Support for further details. Thanks to Sue Butala
      at Transarc technical support for her help with this issue and
      many others.

    - It seems that macros with a variable number of arguments are a
      gcc extension, and other compilers generate errors processing
      them. Those macros have been modified so that warnings will occur
      rather than errors when using a compiler other than gcc.
      Generating debugging output, which relies on variable-argument
      macros, is only supported when using gcc. If you are unable to use
      gcc, I suggest you request that your compiler vendor implement
      these useful preprocessor extensions.

    - Fixed sec_login_context_from_pag typo. Thanks to Titus J. Anderson
      <titus.anderson@louisville.edu> for pointing it out.

    - Misuse of the apache check_access API stage broke the Satisfy
      directive, and possibly other IP access control mechanisms.
      Updated API usage to resolve these issues. Thanks to Ken Hagan
      <khhaga01@louisville.edu> for reporting this problem.

    - The sec_login_inq_pag call seems to return invalid data when the
      DFS client is not installed and configured. Added a compile-time
      directive to determine whether DFS support is available, and
      implemented a replacement mechanism for obtaining the pag when it
      is not. Thanks to Joel W. Murphy <jmurphy@cnu.acsu.buffalo.edu>
      for reporting this problem.


3.0 - Implemented new shared memory context cache, with the following
      new configuration directives: AuthDCECacheBuckets,
      AuthDCECacheLifetime, AuthDCECacheMaxIdle, AuthDCECacheGracePeriod,
      AuthDCECacheSweepInterval. Caching is only supported on Solaris
      in this release.

    - Added new directive AuthDCECertifyIdentify.

    - Renamed following directives: DCEUser to AuthDCEUser, DCEKeytab to
      AuthDCEKeytab, DCEAuthAuthoritative to AuthDCEAuthoritative,
      DCEBrowserCreds to AuthDCEImpersonateBrowser, AuthDFS to
      AuthDCEDFSAuthorization, DCEIncludePW to AuthDCEIncludePW,
      DCEDirectoryIndex to AuthDCEDirectoryIndex.

    - Modified server credential support to generate and maintain
      credentials in parent process rather than per child process.

    - Updated sample httpd.conf to match current Cal Poly Pomona
      Intranet configuration.

    - Much thanks to Craig Rich for his invaluable assistance
      developing this version.


2.5 - Updated logging code to use 1.3 API.

    - Updated configuration to utilize 1.3 auto-configure capabilities.

    - Updated patch for Apache 1.3.9.


2.2 - Updated module to correctly handle proxy authentication. Thanks to
      Thomas R. Stevenson <aa0026@wayne.edu> for pointing out the problem.

    - Included the httpd.conf file used in production in the Cal Poly
      Pomona Intranet as an example configuration file.


2.1 - Fixed typos in Configuration file for AIX systems. Thanks to
      Mike Burns <burns@cac.psu.edu> and Bas van der Vlies <basv@sara.nl>
      for pointing out the problems.

    - Cast parameter types to match function prototypes for various calls.
      Thanks again to Mike and Bas.

    - Restore server credentials after serving a request using browser
      credentials.  Thanks once more to Mike for catching this oversight.


2.0 - Updated patches for Apache 1.3.3. Note that logging still uses the
      older Apache logging API, which results in somewhat confusing logs.
      Hopefully the next release will update the logging code.

    - Added two new directives, DCEUser and DCEKeytab, that allow the
      server to run authenticated as a DCE principal.

    - Added a new directive, DCEBrowserCreds, that controls whether or not
      the credentials of the authenticated browser are attached to the
      server process while satisfying the request.

    - Added a new directive, DCEAuthAuthoritative, that controls whether
      mod_auth_dce is authoritative or allows other modules to try
      authentication when DCE fails.

    - Minor changes to internal context caching mechanism. Child processes
      now clear their context caches on exit to prevent credential pile-up.

    - Group checking now uses default registry handle rather than creating
      an explicit binding.

    - Removed -I/usr/include/dce from CFLAGS. This directive caused the
      wrong assert.h header to be included.

    - Modify require line parsing to use ap_getword_white() to match new
      behavior of other authentication modules in 1.3.3.

    - Removed the README.BUGS file and test subdirectory.

      
1.5 - Updated for Apache 1.3.x, will no longer work with earlier versions
      of Apache. Sorry for the delayed release.

    - DCEDirectoryIndex configuration directive must now be placed within
      a <Directory></Directory> section to be properly handled by Apache.


1.3 - Added DCEIncludePW configuration directive, which enables passing
      browser passwords to CGIs. Previous versions of mod_auth_dce
      always passed the browser password to a CGI, which on a machine that
      allowed interactive logins could potentially expose browser passwords
      to users via the ps command. Thanks to Mark Plaksin
      <happy@arches.uga.edu> for pointing out this problem.

    - Revised advice about symlink checking. Previously, it was recommended
      that symlinks be allowed in general. However, if your web server
      publishes user files, a user can use a symlink to potentially read
      other users DCE credential files. Therefore, the current
      recommendation is to either disable symlinks, or only allow symlinks
      if the owner matches.

    - Removed patches for Apache 1.1.3, 1.2.0, and Stronghold 1.3.4.
      Added patches for Apache 1.2.4 and Apache 1.2.4+ssl_1.9. Versions
      of Apache older than 1.2.4 are no longer supported. No version of
      Stronghold is currently supported, mainly due to their decision to
      incorporate IP address based licensing restrictions and not
      distribute full source code without a non-disclosure agreement.

    - Added support for credential caching under AIX. Thanks to Klaus
      Gottschalk <ox01@saturn.rz.uni-karlsruhe.de> for the implementation
      details of afs_syscall under AIX, and to Mark Plaksin for providing
      access to an AIX environment to test them.


1.2 - Added support for Apache 1.2.0 and included a patch file for that
      version.

    - Added ability to use web server configuration for authorization.
      Sites without DFS ACLs can now use DCE for authentication, while
      relying on require directives for authorization. Added new
      configuration directive, AuthDFS, to allow both web server based
      and DFS ACL based authorization.


1.0 - Patch for Apache 1.1.3 appeared to be for a nonexistant version 1.3.2,
      renamed patch and updated README.PATCHES.

    - Added patch for mod_userdir, which was using the r->finfo structure
      for a local stat. Added a local stat structure so the module would
      not contaminate the request structure, which was having side effects
      on mod_auth_dce.

    - Added new configuration command, DCEDirectoryIndex, to fix problem
      where authentication was being requested for a world-readable index
      file in a non-world-readable directory.


0.9 - First publicly released version

    - Thanks to Steve Moyer <moyer@transarc.com>, for invaluable technical
      support and advice on DFS issues, Doug MacEachern <dougm@osf.org> for
      help with context caching implementation, and Craig Rich
      <carich@csupomona.edu> for inspiration.
