1.0 - Patch for Apache 1.1.3 appeared to be for a nonexistant version 1.3.2,
      renamed patch and updated README.PATCHES.

    - Added patch for mod_userdir, which was using the r->finfo structure
      for a local stat. Added a local stat structure so the module would
      not contaminate the request structure, which was having side effects
      on mod_auth_dce.

    - Added new configuration command, DCEDirectoryIndex, to fix problem
      where authentication was being requested for a world-readable index
      file in a non-world-readable directory.


0.9 - First publicly released version
