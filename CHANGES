2.5 - Updated logging code to use 1.3 API.

    - Updated configuration to utilize 1.3 auto-configure capabilities.

    - Updated patch for Apache 1.3.9.


2.2 - Updated module to correctly handle proxy authentication. Thanks to
      Thomas R. Stevenson <aa0026@wayne.edu> for pointing out the problem.

    - Included the httpd.conf file used in production in the Cal Poly
      Pomona Intranet as an example configuration file.


2.1 - Fixed typos in Configuration file for AIX systems. Thanks to
      Mike Burns <burns@cac.psu.edu> and Bas van der Vlies <basv@sara.nl>
      for pointing out the problems.

    - Cast parameter types to match function prototypes for various calls.
      Thanks again to Mike and Bas.

    - Restore server credentials after serving a request using browser
      credentials.  Thanks once more to Mike for catching this oversight.


2.0 - Updated patches for Apache 1.3.3. Note that logging still uses the
      older Apache logging API, which results in somewhat confusing logs.
      Hopefully the next release will update the logging code.

    - Added two new directives, DCEUser and DCEKeytab, that allow the
      server to run authenticated as a DCE principal.

    - Added a new directive, DCEBrowserCreds, that controls whether or not
      the credentials of the authenticated browser are attached to the
      server process while satisfying the request.

    - Added a new directive, DCEAuthAuthoritative, that controls whether
      mod_auth_dce is authoritative or allows other modules to try
      authentication when DCE fails.

    - Minor changes to internal context caching mechanism. Child processes
      now clear their context caches on exit to prevent credential pile-up.

    - Group checking now uses default registry handle rather than creating
      an explicit binding.

    - Removed -I/usr/include/dce from CFLAGS. This directive caused the
      wrong assert.h header to be included.

    - Modify require line parsing to use ap_getword_white() to match new
      behavior of other authentication modules in 1.3.3.

    - Removed the README.BUGS file and test subdirectory.

      
1.5 - Updated for Apache 1.3.x, will no longer work with earlier versions
      of Apache. Sorry for the delayed release.

    - DCEDirectoryIndex configuration directive must now be placed within
      a <Directory></Directory> section to be properly handled by Apache.


1.3 - Added DCEIncludePW configuration directive, which enables passing
      browser passwords to CGIs. Previous versions of mod_auth_dce
      always passed the browser password to a CGI, which on a machine that
      allowed interactive logins could potentially expose browser passwords
      to users via the ps command. Thanks to Mark Plaksin
      <happy@arches.uga.edu> for pointing out this problem.

    - Revised advice about symlink checking. Previously, it was recommended
      that symlinks be allowed in general. However, if your web server
      publishes user files, a user can use a symlink to potentially read
      other users DCE credential files. Therefore, the current
      recommendation is to either disable symlinks, or only allow symlinks
      if the owner matches.

    - Removed patches for Apache 1.1.3, 1.2.0, and Stronghold 1.3.4.
      Added patches for Apache 1.2.4 and Apache 1.2.4+ssl_1.9. Versions
      of Apache older than 1.2.4 are no longer supported. No version of
      Stronghold is currently supported, mainly due to their decision to
      incorporate IP address based licensing restrictions and not
      distribute full source code without a non-disclosure agreement.

    - Added support for credential caching under AIX. Thanks to Klaus
      Gottschalk <ox01@saturn.rz.uni-karlsruhe.de> for the implementation
      details of afs_syscall under AIX, and to Mark Plaksin for providing
      access to an AIX environment to test them.


1.2 - Added support for Apache 1.2.0 and included a patch file for that
      version.

    - Added ability to use web server configuration for authorization.
      Sites without DFS ACLs can now use DCE for authentication, while
      relying on require directives for authorization. Added new
      configuration directive, AuthDFS, to allow both web server based
      and DFS ACL based authorization.


1.0 - Patch for Apache 1.1.3 appeared to be for a nonexistant version 1.3.2,
      renamed patch and updated README.PATCHES.

    - Added patch for mod_userdir, which was using the r->finfo structure
      for a local stat. Added a local stat structure so the module would
      not contaminate the request structure, which was having side effects
      on mod_auth_dce.

    - Added new configuration command, DCEDirectoryIndex, to fix problem
      where authentication was being requested for a world-readable index
      file in a non-world-readable directory.


0.9 - First publicly released version

    - Thanks to Steve Moyer <moyer@transarc.com>, for invaluable technical
      support and advice on DFS issues, Doug MacEachern <dougm@osf.org> for
      help with context caching implementation, and Craig Rich
      <carich@csupomona.edu> for inspiration.
